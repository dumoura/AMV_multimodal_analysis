The production of the 6th entry in the main AMV Hell series has been a long and frustrating process for all involved. It was originally to be ""AMV Hell 6: The End of the Universe 2012"", and was directed by SSGWNBTD. It was originally planned to premiere at Otakon, but the plans fell through as the project was not completed, and then it was scheduled instead to premiere at Anime Weekend Atlanta in September of 2012. The showing went ahead as planned, but the project was in a rough and unfinished state, and much of the initial feedback was that of disappointment due to the fact that the quality of the project did not stand up to the standards set by previous entries.

After several further weeks of delays without much getting accomplished, the project was handed over to Zarxrax, and the decision was made that the only way to salvage the project was to reopen it for more entries, which of course meant more delays as well. This proved to be the right decision, as loads of quality clips suddenly came flooding in. After a few more months of work, only about 1/3 of the original project remained, the rest having been completely replaced. The new project, now dubbed ""AMV Hell 6.66: This Is (Not) The End"" premiered to an audience of over 800 viewers at Sakura Con on March 30, 2013. Finally, after a few more weeks of tweaking and finalizing things, the project was released online on April 19, 2013.",,2013-04-19 16:49:25+00:00,352955.0,3936.0,,1325.0,PT1H26M2S,sd,false,Friday,5162.0
